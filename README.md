# BootCamp

This assignment is to show how I utilized bootstrap to redo the first assignment.

The about me is to just a brief introduction to me. It describes my background and shows my aspirations. 
In the portfolio, these are just stand in to showcase the later works that I will add in the coming months. 
The contact me will allow anyone to reach out to me once operational.


The first commit was to transfer the work onto my desktop. I was still having issues lining up the text box in front of the images in the portfolio html.

The second commit was to finish my assignment. I edited the about me section and finished fixing the portfolio issues. I also deleted a lot of unused css lines and removed some of the call outs in the htmls.

The third commit is to update the README.md document.

Fourth commit is to update folder
